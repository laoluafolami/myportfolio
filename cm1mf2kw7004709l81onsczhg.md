This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process of designing and configuring a secure and scalable cloud network on **Microsoft Azure**. Aimed at beginners, this guide focuses on key elements like Virtual Networks (VNets), subnets, VPN gateways, ExpressRoute, Network Security Groups (NSGs), and Application Gateways. We’ll create a real-world project to demonstrate how to set up an enterprise-grade cloud network infrastructure in Azure.

## Project Title: Building Secure and Scalable Network Infrastructure for Acme Corporation

**Objective:**  
The goal is to build a secure, scalable, and highly available cloud network for **Acme Corporation**, which needs to connect its on-premises data center to Azure and host secure web applications.

---

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

---

#### **Step 1: Define Project Objectives**

Before we dive into the configuration, we need to define the core objectives:

* **Security:** Ensure that only authorized traffic flows between resources.
    
* **Scalability:** The infrastructure should handle future growth without significant rework.
    
* **Availability:** Ensure that the network remains available even during failures or outages.
    
* **Performance:** Minimize latency for end users, ensuring a fast and reliable experience.

#### **Step 2: Set Up Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)**

**Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)** are the building blocks of your cloud network. We’ll start by creating two VNets in different regions for redundancy and availability.

Logging to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)

Create two Virtual networks (Vnets)

**How to Create VNets:**

1. In the Azure Portal, go to `Create a Resource` -&gt; `Networking` -&gt; `Virtual Network`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727524393582/80a0a3b1-dd64-49e6-812c-42ef04608c29.png align="center")
    
2. Configure the Address Space and Subnets for **VNet1** and **VNet2**.
    
    * **Frontend Subnet:** Hosts web servers and publicly accessible services.
        
    * **Backend Subnet:** Hosts databases and internal application servers.
        
    * **Gateway Subnet:** Used for VPN connectivity between on-premises and Azure.
        

1. **VNet1** (Primary Region: East US)
    
    * **Address Space:** 10.0.0.0/16
        
    * **Subnets:**
        
        * Frontend Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24
            
        * Backend Subnet: 10.0.2.0/24
            
        * Gateway Subnet: 10.0.3.0/27
            
            ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727527600880/9a1c0984-9cc4-4f78-b896-e4417bba48cd.png align="center")
            
2. **VNet2** (Secondary Region: West Europe)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727527836542/d5bac214-2282-4e11-bf29-060a06f46984.png align="center")
    
    * **Address Space:** 10.1.0.0/16
        
    * **Subnets:**
        
        * Frontend Subnet: 10.1.1.0/24
            
        * Backend Subnet: 10.1.2.0/24
            
        * Gateway Subnet: 10.1.3.0/27
            
            ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727528084723/d62db9db-f1b0-4507-9458-1b2074a73be0.png align="center")
            
            #### **Step 3: Implement VNet Peering**
            
            Peering allows VNets to communicate securely and privately. Let’s set up peering between **VNet1** and **VNet2** for low-latency, secure traffic between the two regions.
            
            1. Go to the **VNet1** -&gt; `Settings` -&gt; `Peering`.
                
            2. Select **VNet2** as the peer network.
                
            3. Enable traffic forwarding to allow full communication between VNets.

* **Benefits of Peering:**
    
    * Low-latency, secure communication.
        
    * No need for VPNs between VNets

#### **Step 4: Configure VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute for Secure Connectivity**

To securely connect the on-premises data center to Azure, you can use a **VPN Gateway** or **ExpressRoute**:

1. **VPN Gateway**:
    
    * In the Azure Portal, go to `Create a Resource` \-&gt; `Networking` \-&gt; `VPN Gateway`.
        
    * Select the **Gateway Subnet** for deployment.
        
    * Configure a Site-to-Site VPN connection with your on-premises data center.
        
2. **ExpressRoute** (Optional):
    
    * Use ExpressRoute if you need private, high-speed connectivity between on-premises and Azure.
        
    * Create an ExpressRoute Circuit and connect it to the **Virtual Networks** for faster, more secure communication.
        
    * ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727535735692/35347700-6ec6-4dae-80ec-778064cb02f2.png align="center")

#### **Step 5: Set Up Network Security Groups (NSGs)**

**NSGs** allow you to control traffic to your subnets by creating inbound and outbound security rules.

**How to Configure NSGs:**

1. Go to "Create a Resource" -&gt; `Networking` -&gt; `Network Security Group`.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727536442522/c2e527fa-824e-4b9f-b965-1e3290653161.png align="center")
    
2. Apply the NSG to the **Frontend Subnet**.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727536805463/c5ee48dc-4ce7-4dff-8320-83e64c4d213b.png align="center")
    
3. Configure rules to:
    
    * Allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Inbound).
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537159737/eda62a39-cf2a-44c2-8ca2-96ab601697c5.png align="center")
        
    * Block all other inbound traffic by default
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537250961/3da333dd-13cb-4ab3-829d-d7f9801caf46.png align="center")
        
4. Create a second NSG for the **Backend Subnet**:
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537393070/a0a51a5a-9ddd-45e0-9dad-8e0d741747b5.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537421337/327bcbd2-ee24-466d-9ada-b07920821fdd.png align="center")
    
    * Only allow traffic from the Frontend Subnet to the Backend Subnet.
        

**NSG Best Practices:**

* Use **least privilege** principles to restrict access to only necessary services.
    

Create custom rules for specific ports and IPs.

#### **Step 6: Configure Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF)**

An **Application Gateway** provides secure and scalable web traffic routing, including **SSL termination** and protection via **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**.

**How to Set Up Application Gateway:**

1. Go to "Create a Resource" -&gt; "Networking" -&gt; "Application Gateway."
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537954651/aa6531c2-b695-42b8-84d5-9bea6675ee61.png align="center")
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727537999048/9fb84509-9b2f-499a-a496-e98c85732b1c.png align="center")
    
2. Select the **Frontend Subnet** for the gateway.
    
3. Enable **WAF** to protect your web applications from common threats like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), etc.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727538069022/a2401676-3650-409c-9fe3-c04b2a207e56.png align="center")
    

Configure SSL termination to offload SSL decryption from your web servers, improving performance.

#### **Step 7: Implement Best Practices for Security, Scalability, and Availability**

* **Security**:
    
    * Enable **DDoS Protection** for your VNets to safeguard against volumetric attacks.
        
    * ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727539234838/6a1183cb-887b-48ed-b12b-b2f11f1f2034.png align="center")
        
    * Use **Azure Firewall** for comprehensive network filtering and traffic control.
        
* **Scalability**:
    
    * Configure **Auto-scaling** for virtual machines and application gateways to automatically adjust capacity based on traffic load.
        
        ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727539418054/33936177-8f6d-46b2-bb8f-fec6a0bcc952.png align="center")
        
    * Use **Azure Load Balancer** to distribute traffic across multiple VMs.
        
* **Availability**:
    
    * Deploy resources in **Availability Zones** for redundancy and disaster recovery.
        
    * Use **Azure Traffic Manager** for geographic routing, ensuring users are served by the closest or best-performing region (East US or West Europe).
